Hi!

I'm Nicky. I've been on and offlearning to code for a while now, and found what I'm definitely not interested in: front-end web design. 
My current challenge is to get through the [CS50X](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/notes/1/). After that, I may venture into the [Back End Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend) or [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) (I have grand dreams of replacing MyFitnessPal with a cheaper, *ads free*, version, if only for my sake).

You can reach me at nicky.johnson@outlook.com.
